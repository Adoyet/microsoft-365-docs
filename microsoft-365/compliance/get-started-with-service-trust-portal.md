# Get started with Microsoft Service Trust Portal

The Microsoft Service Trust Portal provides a variety of content, tools, and other resources about Microsoft security, privacy, and compliance practices.

## Accessing the Service Trust Portal

The Service Trust Portal is Microsoft's public site for publishing audit reports and other compliance-related information associated with Microsoft’s cloud services. STP users can download audit reports produced by external auditors and gain insight from Microsoft-authored whitepapers that provide details on how Microsoft builds and operates cloud services. To access some of the resources on the Service Trust Portal, you must log in as an authenticated user with your Microsoft cloud services account (Azure Active Directory organization account) and review and accept the Microsoft Non-Disclosure Agreement for Compliance Materials.

### Existing customers

Existing customers can access the Service Trust Portal at <https://aka.ms/STP> with one of the following online subscriptions (trial or paid):

- Microsoft 365
- Dynamics 365
- Azure

 > [!NOTE]
 > Azure Active Directory accounts associated with organizations have access to the full range of documents and resources like Compliance Manager.

### New customers and customers evaluating Microsoft online services

To create a new account or to create a trial account, use one of the following sign-up forms (also used for trial accounts) to get access to the STP.

- Sign up for a new [Microsoft 365 Apps for business trial account](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=507653) or a new [Office 365 Enterprise trial account](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=698279)

When you sign up for either a free trial, or a subscription, you must enable Azure Active Directory to support your access to the STP.

> Many of the files on the STP require acceptance of a license agreement. Some browser-based PDF viewers do not allow Javascript to run, which prevents the license agreement from being displayed and the file from opening.

### My Library

This feature lets you save (or *pin*) documents so that you can quickly access them on your My Library page. You can also set up notifications so that Microsoft sends you an email message when documents in your My Library are updated. For more information, see the [My Library](#my-library-1) section in this article.

By default, the search returns document results. You can filter the results by using the dropdown lists to refine the list of documents displayed. You can use multiple filters to narrow the list of documents. Filters include the specific cloud services, and regions. Click the document name link to download the document.

## My Library

Use the My Library feature to add documents and resources on the Service Trust Portal to your My Library page. This lets you access documents that are relevant to you in a single place.  To add a document to your My Library, click the **...** menu to the right of a document and then select **Save to library**. You can add multiple documents to your My Library by clicking the checkbox next to one or more documents, and then clicking **Save to library** at the top of the page.

Additionally, the notifications feature lets you configure your My Library so that an email message is sent to you whenever Microsoft updates a document that you've added to your My Library. To set up notifications, go to your My Library and click **Notification Settings**. You can choose the frequency of notifications and specify an email address in your organization to send notifications to. Email notifications include links to the documents that have been updated and a brief description of the update.

Also note that we identify any documents in your My Library that have been updated within the last 30 days, regardless of whether or not you turn on notifications. A brief description of the update is also displayed in a tool tip.
